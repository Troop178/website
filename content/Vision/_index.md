## Joining Requirements
Our Scouts BSA program is available to boys who
have earned the Arrow of Light rank and are at least
10 years old, or have completed the fifth grade and
are at least 10 year old, or who are 11 years old, and
who are not yet 18 years old.

### How to Join
Complete a BSA Youth Membership Application
and an Annual Health and Medical Record, and pay
the annual troop dues. Dues will be prorated for
scouts who join mid-year.

### What happens next?
You will be assigned to a patrol, which is a group of
6-8 scouts of similar age in our troop. One scout is
elected by the patrol to be the Patrol Leader, who
accepts the responsibility to help is fellow scouts
along the way. Younger scout patrols are also as-
signed a Troop Guide, who is an older Scout who
helps the Patrol Leader to carry out his duties.
Your first task will be to earn the Scout rank, where
you will learn the basics of being a scout.


## The Basics

### Meetings

Regular troop meetings are held are held from Septem-
ber through June every Wednesday, except for the sec-
ond Wednesday of the month and when School is not in
session. Meetings run from 7:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.
Meetings are held in the basement of Saint Pius Tenth
School, 3000 Chili Avenue, Rochester, NY 14624.

### Campouts
Troop 178 camps about once a month. Most campouts
are weekend trips, running from Friday evening through
Sunday morning. We attend a weeklong Summer Camp
in July.

### Cost
Annual dues are $99 in 2018-19. This includes:
• $33 BSA national membership fees
• $6 Insurance
• $60 Troop program expenses
Some troop activities will have additional fees.
“A Scout is Thrifty.” Scouts are encouraged to “earn
their own way” through active participation in troop
fundraising activities. Scouts earn credits for fundraising
participation, and dues are waived when a scout earns
enough credits.
We are committed to providing our program to all boys,
regardless of their family’s financial situation. Speak to
the Scoutmaster if you require financial assistance.

### Duty to God
The BSA maintains that no member can grow into the
best kind of citizen without recognizing an obligation to
God and, therefore, recognizes the religious element in
the training of the member, but is absolutely nonsec-
tarian in its attitude toward that religious training.




## What You Need

### Uniform
All scouts wear a Field Uniform, commonly referred to as

a “Class A” uniform. New scouts receive an Activity Uni-
form tee shirt (“Class B”) with our troop logo. About

once a year, scouts will also have the opportunity to or-
der additional (optional) gear with our troop logo.

### You will need to purchase:
- Field Uniform shirt
- Seneca Waterways Council Shoulder Patch
- World Crest Emblem
- Merit Badge sash
- Scouts BSA Handbook for Boys

### The Troop will provide at no additional cost:
- Uniform shoulder loops
- Troop “178” numeral patch
- Patrol emblem
- Troop neckerchief and slide
- Troop tee shirt
Also available for purchase are uniform hat, uniform
pants and shorts, uniform belt and uniform socks. We

encourage but do not require Scouts to be in full uni-
form.

Uniform items are available for purchase at the Strong
Scout Shop, 2320 Brighton-Henrietta Townline Road.
“Experienced” uniform parts can often be found at local
consignment shops and online at a reduced cost.
Camping Gear
Troop 178 provides tents and cooking gear for all scouts
on campouts. Scouts should have their own sleeping
bag, backpack, mess kit and personal gear, as appropri-
ate for the type of outing.

The Troop has some sleeping bags, sleeping pads, back-
packs and mess kits available for loan if needed.
